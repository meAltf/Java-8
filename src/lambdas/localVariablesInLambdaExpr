Lambdas and Local Variables

-- Local Variable--

- Any variable that is declared inside a method is called a local variable.

- Lambdas have some restrictions on using local Variables:

-- Not allowed to use the same the local variable name as lambda parameters or inside the lambda body.

-- Not allowed re-assign a value to a local variable.

---- No restriction on instance variables.
