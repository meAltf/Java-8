Parallel Stream -

1- Splits the source of data into multiple parts
2- Process them parallel
3- combine the result

How to create a parallel stream-

-Sequential Stream-
    IntStream.rangeClosed(1,1000)
    .sum();

-Parallel Stream-
    IntStream.rangeClosed(1,1000)
    .parallel()
    .sum();

How Parallel Stream works-

- Parallel Stream uses the Fork/Join framework that got introduced in Java7
   - Fork/Join framework, creates multiples threads for parallel stream


How many Threads are created ?

- Number of threads created == number of processor available in the machine
