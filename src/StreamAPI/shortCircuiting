--- Short Circuiting ---

1- In an expression, if two boolean variable are and the operation will be "AND"
   then,
   If the first expression evaluates to "false" then the second expression won't even execute


2- In an expression, if two boolean variable are and the operation will be "OR"
   then,
   If the first expression evaluates to "true" then the second expression won't even execute

3- limit() | findFirst() | findAny() | anyMatch() | allMatch() | noneMatch() ->
    - All these functions doesn't have to iterate the whole stream to evaluate the result..
