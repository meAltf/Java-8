## Collections and Streams

- Collections
 - Can add or modify elements at any point of time.
 -List-> list.add(<Element>)

 - Elements in the collection can be accessed in any order.use appropriate methods based on the collection.
 - like, List-> list.get(4);

 - Collections is eagerly constructed.

 - Collections can be traversed "n" number of times.
 -    -Perform EXTERNAL ITERATION to iterate through the elements.


 -Streams
    -Cannot add or modify elements in the stream.
    - It is a fixed data set.
    -Elements in the stream can be accessed only in sequence.
    - Streams lazily constructed.

    - Streams can be traversed only once.
    -Perform INTERNAL ITERATION to iterate through the elements.
